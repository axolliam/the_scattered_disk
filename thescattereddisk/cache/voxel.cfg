			description = the largest moon of aron, and most certianly the wierdest, due to its orbit, and the fact it orbits retrograde compared to the other moons, it is hypothosized to have been a captured dwarf planet originating in the kuiper belt, its small moon, lilam, a object it captured when it first barged through the aron system, it also seems to have sent a couple objects into arons roche limit, generating some rings that are activly being tugged on by voxel
